Created by underscore (speeds_)

NOTE: SEEMS TO BE A LOSS IN FPS WHEN OPENING THE MENU, THIS IS NOT SOLVED YET. FPS IS DROPPING FROM 1000 TO 700-800, MAY BE CREATING EXTRA PANELS WHEN THERE IS NOT AN ITEM THERE.

Inventory is a work in progress, feel free to use this in your server, let me know if you do :)
